Dr. Nathan Van Schmidt 🦆 Director of Waterbird Science at the [San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory](https://sfbbo.org).
I research habitat use and population dynamics of migratory and resident waterbirds, with a non-exclusive focus on salt ponds.
I use a diverse quantitative modeling skillset that includes both statistical analysis (R, Python, JAGS, hierarchical modeling)
and simulation modeling (NetLogo, HexSim, SyncroSim). A major emphasis of my work is the use of empirical simulation models
to project the coupled dynamics of working landscapes and wildlife populations under global change.
