Dr. Nathan Van Schmidt 🦆 Director of Waterbird Science at San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory (sfbbo.org).
I research habitat use and population dynamics of migratory and resident waterbirds, with a non-exclusive focus on salt ponds.
I use a diverse quantitative modeling skillset that includes both statistical analysis (R, occupancy modeling, hierarchical
modeling, autoregression, Bayesian) and simulation modeling (NetLogo, HexSim, SyncroSim). A major emphasis of my work is the
use of empirical simulation models to project the coupled dynamics of landscapes and wildlife populations under global change.
